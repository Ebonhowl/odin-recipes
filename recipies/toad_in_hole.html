    <h2><strong>Method</strong></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to gas 7, 220°C, fan 200°C</li>
        <li>First make the batter. Put the flour in a bowl, add the eggs and slowly mix in the milk then beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Put the sausages in an ovenproof baking dish, scatter over the sliced onion and drizzle over the oil. Roast for 15 mins.</li>
        <li>Remove the dish from the oven, pour the batter over and around the sausages then return to the oven and cook for a further 35 mins or until the sausages are cooked through and the batter is golden on top.</li>
        <li>To make the gravy, heat a deep frying pan or saucepan and fry the remaining onion in the oil for 5 mins until golden. Sprinkle over the flour and cook, stirring until thickened. Add the mustard, Worcestershire sauce and, gradually, the stock, stirring until smooth and thickened to your liking.</li>
        <li>Serve the toad in the hole with the gravy to pour over.</li>
